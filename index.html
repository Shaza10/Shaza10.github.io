	<h3>Shackleton's Life</h3>
	<img src= "images/shackletonicon.jpg" alt= "Picture of Earnest Shackleton" />
	
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton" > Sir Ernest Shackleton</a> was an Anglo-Irish Antarctic explorer and is famous, principally, for leading the Imperial Trans-Antartic (Endurance) Expedition of 1914-16.</p>

	<p>He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antartic Exploration. Educated at Dulwich College and having ignored his father's wishes that he become a doctor he joined the merchant navy. Of many quotes one of his most famous is,"Difficulties are just things to overcome, after all."</p> 

	<p>During his life he made three trips to the Antarctic. As well as climbing Mount Erebus he made many important scientific discoveries. On his fourth expedition to circumnavigate the Antartic he died of a heart attack. He was buried on the Island of South Georgia.</p>

<p>Three components on one game area.</p>
<p>Notice that the stack order of the components depends on the order they were updated in the updateGameArea function. The blue game piece is updated last, and will be placed on top of the yellow, which will be placed on top of the red.</p>
